# Financial Analysis Project
A Python project for extracting, analyzing and clustering financial concepts using language models and Neo4j.

## extractor.py
The ArticleExtractor module utilizes BeautifulSoup to extract the main content from web pages. Given the varying HTML structures across different websites, multiple extraction strategies are implemented to ensure flexibility and accuracy. Irrelevant elements are programmatically removed using BeautifulSoup to retain only meaningful content.
After extraction, a large language model (LLM) is employed to summarize each article. For improved performance and cost efficiency, this can be substituted with a local summarization model available on Hugging Face. The final outputs are aggregated into a structured JSON format for downstream use.
This component also supports rate limiting and parallel processing to ensure scalable and robust performance.

## visualizer.py
The Visualizer module focuses primarily on extracting causal relationships from articles rather than on visual rendering itself. To achieve this, the Hugging Face model "Babelscape/rebel-large" is used to identify relationships within the text. These are then filtered to retain only those that represent causality.
The extracted causal links are stored in a Neo4j graph database. A corresponding interactive visualization is generated and saved as knowledge_graph.html.

## clustering.py
The Clustering module constructs a graph from the Neo4j-stored data and applies the Louvain algorithm for community detection. This method is particularly suitable for financial data, where hierarchical relationships often emerge from derivative concepts and layered dependencies.
### Current limitations:
The input dataset may be too small to reveal clear hierarchical structuresâ€”expanding the dataset could lead to a more connected and informative graph.
The relationship extraction model may miss some causal connections due to inherent limitations in its capability.

## Future directions and open-ended exploration:
Data Scaling: Ingesting a larger volume of articles will enhance the quality and structure of the knowledge graph, enabling better clustering and relationship detection.
Automated Insight Generation: A future extension could involve deploying an autonomous agent that continuously ingests the latest financial news, updates the knowledge graph, and sends real-time alerts based on emerging causal patterns. This could help users react swiftly to unfolding events with contextual insights.
